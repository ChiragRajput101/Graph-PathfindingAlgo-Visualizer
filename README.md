## **Graph PathFinding Visualizer**

Employees the Djiskra's Shortest Path Algorithm, to find the most cost-effective route between the Start Node and the Goal Node <br>
The project features user-interactable walls, that can be created/destriyed by toggling individual cell (nodes) in the grid <br>

The path, must not pass through these walls <br>
All the nodes that are visited during the search are highlighted in the same order using CSS <br>
The shortest path (in the currently-unweighted graph) is then animmated from start to goal <br>
